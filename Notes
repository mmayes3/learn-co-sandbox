#touch creates .rb file in terminal. Acces by using rube "file name".rb
Print using: print, puts:(prints with a \n), or p: (prints with literal code/does not return nil)
Use (loop do) to create an infinite loop
to avoid multiple elsif's use case

Strategies for Getting Unstuck: Simplify the problem,Research similar problems and solutions, don't want to cut and paste code into your own solution, Look at the problem from a different angle,Break the problem down into smaller parts, Start with a solution and solve the problem backwards, Run Uphill: Do the "Hard Thing" You Don't Want to Do. 
pseudocode:
Procedure DivideBaguetteEvenly(baguette, n):
  baguette_length = measure(baguette)
  even_length = baguette_length / n
  collection = []
 
  while baguette_length > even_length:
    piece, rest = cut_bread(baguette, even_length)
    collection.add(piece)
 
    baguette = rest
    baguette_length = measure(baguette)
 
  even_pieces = collection
  return even_pieces
  Introducing State Tables
State tables are tables that keep track of the inputs, outputs, local variables, and conditions in a bounded or fenced-off "bloc" of code or pseudocode.
